title: Indoor positioning system
---
Recently I read some ML tutorials, and found Google can now determine where the photo was taken [[1]](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/600889/google-unveils-neural-network-with-superhuman-ability-to-determine-the-location-of-almost/) without using the GPS metadata. That makes think about indoor positioning.

Imagine when you are lost, you turn on the camera of your cellphone, Google can relaize where you are, and can suggest you direction by AR. This way we don't need any beacon or physical tags.

I am quite exicited with this idea!
