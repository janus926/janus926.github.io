title: Moving from Blogger
---

I am too lazy to import the posts from Blogger, just let the history stays [there](http://janus926.blogspot.tw).

So I simply forked [poole/lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) to build this site, it's easy for me, but I don't know is it easy for non-programmer to handle those git things. Anyway, this is going to change my flow of writing things. Hopefully it's a positive move.
