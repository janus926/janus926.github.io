title: Indoor automatic drone
---
While my colleagues were playing a quadcopter in the office today, I was thinking it should be fun if it can delivery things in the office, automatically, like what Google and Amazon are trying to do at outdoor. I'd be happy seeing a machine fly around the office and do job automatically, like a smart toy. That requires an indoor gps and somehow figure out the path for delivering.

Maybe it can also be a security guard, with video recording.

I just came up two more ideas on the way to the office this morning:

1. Explore a new space by its own
Back in school days, when I played RPG games, entering a map is usually all dark and I need to walk around to figure out what the space is like and found different NPC to interact. That seems the same situation for the drone, so if it can fly around and draws the indoor map automatically, wow, that's nice and very much easier.
2. People can set its waypoint
Now people can set waypoints on the map. Just like drag and drop the waypoint on a pad and the drone will fly there. Maybe use an IR points to the waypoint, or plot some virtual line in drone's sight (VR for the drone).

Sounds interesting, I like this toy!
