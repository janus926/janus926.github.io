title: Indoor automatic drone
---
While my colleagues were playing a quadcopter in the office today, I were thinking it should be fun if it can delivery things in the office, automatically, like what Google and Amazon are trying to do at outdoor. I feel happy seeing a machine fly around the office and do job automatically, like a smart toy. That requires an indoor gps and somehow figure out the path for delivering.

Maybe it can also be a security guard, with video recording.
