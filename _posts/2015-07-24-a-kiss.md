title: A kiss
---
Last night, I lied next to my son on the bed, and thought he fall asleep already, so I sat up and wathced his face. Then he pushed himself up, gave me a kiss, and back to sleep. Without a word.

I melt.

I want to stamp that image in my brain, forever. He will soon never do that to me again, he's growing up, and I'm getting old. 

He is now 30 months old, sometimes an angel and sometimes a devil.
