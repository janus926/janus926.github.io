title: Running on a deep learning platform?

What if it's a deep learning OS or VM, which optimize programs and user experience automitically? Seems quite interesting. I should study neural network, now!

Some to start:

- [Hacker's guide to Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/neuralnets/)  
    - Chapter 1  
        Imagine neuron is a function, which can be represted as gates with input and a single output. With inputs you can move forward along the gates to get output, and you can calculate gradients of each input to higher the ouput with +1 by moving backward (backpropogate).
